# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using `d3.json()`, add the data using the `geoJSON()` layer, set the tectonic plate `LineString` data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using `d3.json()`. You'll also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, `geoJSON()`.

## Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.
